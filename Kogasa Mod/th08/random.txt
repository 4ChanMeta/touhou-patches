This is my first mod. I didn't really know what I was doing most of the time. the sprites suck and idk how to fix it
the shot types are also wildly unbalanced. while i could try to make up a reason i just like being op in games and its fun
hope you didn't mind all the patch's inconsistencies and bugs too much. i got the help of a bunch of lovely people from the zuncode server at https://discord.gg/NJhrdVBmrF to make this.
thats about all. maybe ill make more in the future.
